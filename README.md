"The art of teaching is the art of assisting discovery." (Mark Van Doren)

Here's where we'll discuss efforts to equipment community members with skills that are in demand.

So far we're planning a 96 hour Rails course to be held every Saturday from Apr. 5, 2014 to Jun. 14, 2014. To pull this of we'll need to:
* [Recruit instructors](https://github.com/qcmerge/training/issues/2)
* [Choose or write the cirriculum](https://github.com/qcmerge/training/issues/3)
* [Select or solicit students](https://github.com/qcmerge/training/issues/4)
* [Permit TAs to volunteer for specific course dates](https://github.com/qcmerge/training/issues/5)
